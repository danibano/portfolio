## Description

I created this website to apply my HTML and CSS knowledge. I also want to use this as a page to showcase all the code I make throughout my time in the bootcamp. It'll be helpful to have all of my projects in one place so that I can always go back and refer to them when need be. I learned a lot about CSS and using Flexbox which felt a lot like trial and error. Despite the frustration it gave me, I learned how essential Flexbox is to making one interface look nice across all different screen sizes.
